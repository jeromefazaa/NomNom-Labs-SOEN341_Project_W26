- Project Description: 
MealMajor is a web application designed to help students plan their meals in a simple and organized way. The goal of the project is to allow users to create an account, manage their food preferences and allergies, and easily plan their weekly meals. The application also allows users to create, edit, and view recipes, as well as assign them to specific days and meal types.
By providing a centralized platform for meal planning, MealMajor aims to reduce the stress of deciding what to eat while helping students save time and stay organized. The project is developed following Agile principles, with features implemented incrementally across multiple sprints.

- Sprint 1 Overview:
Sprint 1 focuses on implementing the core user account management features of the MealMajor application. This includes the login and registration interface, user authentication, logout functionality, and basic dashboard navigation. These features establish the foundation needed for future development in later sprints.
